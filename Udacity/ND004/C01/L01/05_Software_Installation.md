**Required Software**

Before getting started, let's make sure you have all the needed software installed. They are:
- ***A Command-Line Interface (CLI)*** like Terminal or GitBash.
- ***Python (be sure it is [version 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later)***

`python --version`</br>
`python3 --version`

- ***pip / pip3***

pip is the package manager for Python, and will be used to install packages that we need from the [Python Package Index(PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). Check if it's already installed using command,

`pip --version`</br>
`pip3 --version`

If you don't have pip installed, you'll get a command not found message. If you do have pip, you should get a result something like this:

`pip 20.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)`

This shows both which version of pip you have (in this case , version 20.1) as well as which version of Python it is connected to (in this case, python 3.7).

If you don't have pip installed with your most recent Python version, then go [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for instructions on how to install or upgrade.

- ***A code editor*** like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), etc.
- ***A web browser*** like [Brave](https://brave.com/download/), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), etc.
