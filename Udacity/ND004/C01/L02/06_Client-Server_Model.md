## Client-Server Model ##
A **server** is a centralized program that communicates over a network (such as the Internet) to serve clients.

And a **client** is a program (like the web browser on your computer) that can request data from a server.

**Servers, Clients, Hosts**
- In a Client-Server Model, a server serves many clients.
- Servers and clients are programs that run on hosts.
- Hosts are computers connected over a network (like the internet!).

**Requests and Responses**
- A client sends a request to the server
- The server's job is to fulfill the request with a response it sends back to the client.
- Requests and responses are served via a communication protocol, which sets up the expectations and rules for how the communication occurs between servers and clients.

**Relational Database Clients**
- A database client is any program that sends requests to a database
- In some cases, the database client is a web server! When your browser makes a request, the web server acts as a server (fulfilling that request), but when the web server requests data from the database, it is acting as a client to that databaseâ€”and the database is the server (because it is fulfilling the request).
